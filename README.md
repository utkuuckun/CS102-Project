# CS102-Project
In this project we created a program which will help highschool student with learning about electric circuits. 
Program has two parts. One part concludes typical electric circuit questions from physic test books.
Other part provides an open sand-box like experience where user can create his\her own circuits with batteries and resistence, and see 
the distribution of voltage and current on different components.

Even though logic of the program was complete, GUI part is unfinished.
